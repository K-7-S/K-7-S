### 😐 But I'm still wondering...

```rust
struct AboutMe;

impl AboutMe {
    const READING_BOOK: &'static str = "The book of life";
    const CURRENT_DEGREE: &'static str = "Master";
    const WANT_TO_UNDERSTAND: &'static str = "WHY we should HOW to do WHAT";
}

trait OpenSource {
    const CONTRIBUTOR_OF: &'static [&'static str] = &["Nope"];
}

impl OpenSource for AboutMe {}
